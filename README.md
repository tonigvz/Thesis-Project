# Thesis Project

This project implements a secure client-server chat application in Python, utilizing RSA encryption for enhanced security. The server handles client connections, message encryption and decryption, and periodic regeneration of encryption keys. On the other hand, the client features a graphical user interface (GUI) enabling users to send and receive encrypted messages. 

## Key Features
- RSA encryption for secure message communication.
- Server manages client connections and key regeneration.
- Client GUI allows intuitive messaging experience.


## Technologies Utilized
- Python
- RSA Encryption
- Socket Programming
- Threading
- Tkinter (for the GUI)

## Usage
1. Run the server script to initiate the server.
2. Run the client script to connect to the server.
3. Enjoy secure and encrypted chat functionality.
